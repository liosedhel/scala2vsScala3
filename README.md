**Scala 2 vs Scala 3 - by examples**

This repo was created to show differences between Scala 2 and Scala 3.
It is a kind of cheat sheet for devs transitioning form Scala 2 to Scala 3.

There is always example of some functionality in Scala 2 (`scala2` folder) and similar example in Scala 3 for comparison with same file name (`scala3` folder).

When working with examples in IDEs, open the `scala2` and `scala3` as separate projects to not confuse scala versions. Each folder can be compiled and run with `scala-cli .`
